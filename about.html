    <h1>About OpenGridMap</h1>
    <p>OpenGridMap is an experimental website, very similar to <a href="https://openinframap.org/">OpenInfraMap</a> (in fact, it's uses the data displayed there). OpenGridMap only shows electrical lines, and not the other infrastructure related items visible on <a href="https://openinframap.org/">OIM</a>. I added a searchbar field, since sometimes I found it hard to find places on <a href="https://openinframap.org/">OIM</a> without it. In case this website is useful for others, I'll keep it, otherwise I'll retire it once I don't need the search functionality.</p>
